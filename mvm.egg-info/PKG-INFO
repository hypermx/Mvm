# Migraine Vulnerability Modeling (MVM)

An open-source project to model migraines as **threshold crossings of a continuously evolving latent vulnerability state**, rather than isolated trigger events.

The goal is to build a scientifically grounded, privacy-conscious, extensible system that helps users understand and stabilize neurological vulnerability over time.

This project is in active development. Contributions are welcome.

## Conceptual Overview

Instead of asking:

> “What caused my migraine?”

We model:

* A latent continuous vulnerability state `v_t`
* Evolving over time based on physiological and behavioral inputs
* Migraines occur when `v_t` crosses a learned threshold

Formally:

```
v_{t+1} = f(v_t, x_t)
migraine_t = 1 if v_t > θ
```

Where:

* `x_t` = observed inputs (sleep, stress, hydration, nutrition, etc.)
* `v_t` = latent vulnerability
* `θ` = personal or global instability threshold

This is implemented as a nonlinear neural state-space model with personalization and intervention simulation capabilities.

---

## Project Goals

* Learn a global representation of migraine dynamics from pooled data
* Adapt models to individual users with minimal personal data
* Enable counterfactual simulation (“What if I sleep 8 hours tonight?”)
* Provide constrained, safe intervention suggestions
* Maintain strong privacy guarantees
* Encourage interdisciplinary collaboration (ML, neuroscience, clinical insight)

---

## Architecture Overview

### Layer 1 – Global Representation Model

A neural state-space backbone (Transformer or TCN-based) that:

* Learns temporal physiological dynamics
* Produces a latent vulnerability state
* Models smooth accumulation and recovery
* Outputs calibrated migraine risk probabilities

Pretraining includes self-supervised sequence learning.

---

### Layer 2 – Personal Adaptation

Lightweight per-user adaptation using:

* Adapter modules or LoRA-style updates
* Personal threshold parameters
* Regularization toward global priors

Designed to prevent overfitting on small personal datasets.

---

### Layer 3 – Counterfactual Engine

Differentiable forward simulation of vulnerability trajectories under hypothetical input sequences.

Supports:

* Multi-day simulation rollouts
* Uncertainty propagation
* Safe intervention constraints

---

### Layer 4 – Policy Optimization

Constrained optimization (initially not RL) that:

* Minimizes predicted threshold crossings
* Respects realistic behavioral bounds
* Outputs ranked intervention suggestions with uncertainty estimates

## Current Scope (v1)

To maintain rigor and stability, the first public version will:

* Use daily time resolution
* Support a limited, validated feature set (sleep, stress, hydration, etc.)
* Include simple baseline models (logistic regression, gradient boosting)
* Avoid medication adjustment recommendations
* Focus on simulation and risk stabilization

Complex extensions (e.g., menstrual cycle modeling, high-frequency data, reinforcement learning) will be added incrementally.

---

## Data & Privacy Principles

Health data requires strong safeguards.

* Encryption in transit and at rest
* Clear anonymization pipeline
* No silent data manipulation
* Explicit missing-data handling
* Transparent privacy documentation

Future roadmap may include federated learning.

---

## Scientific Standards

This is not a “trigger finder.”

We aim to model physiological dynamics responsibly.

All contributions should:

* Include reproducible experiments
* Compare against baseline models
* Provide calibration metrics
* Avoid causal claims unless justified
* Include uncertainty estimates

Pull requests that improve scientific validity are strongly encouraged.

## How to Contribute

We welcome:

* Pull requests (model improvements, infrastructure, UI, testing)
* Documentation improvements
* Benchmark contributions
* Privacy and security review
* Practical experience from:

  * Neuroscience
  * Headache medicine
  * Behavioral science
  * Control systems
  * Causal inference
  * Human-computer interaction

If you have real-world migraine research or clinical experience, your input is especially valuable.

Before submitting a PR:

* Open an issue describing the proposal
* Include reasoning and expected impact
* Provide evaluation metrics
* Add tests where applicable

## Long-Term Vision

To build an open, privacy-respecting, scientifically grounded system that:

* Models neurological vulnerability as a dynamic system
* Enables personalized stabilization strategies
* Bridges machine learning and neuroscience
* Encourages interdisciplinary collaboration
